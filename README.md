* Install requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt (replacing pip with whatever version of pip you use). For best practice do this in an evironement. If you run into issues with pyscopg2 then you can remove those files from the requirements.txt before running and then add them back to requirements.txt after running the command.

* You will also have to install pattern. To install on a mac, run:

```
git clone -b development https://github.com/clips/pattern
cd pattern
sudo python3.6 setup.py install
```
